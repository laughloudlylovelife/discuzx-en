Before you start the upgrade process,

ATTENTION!!!
If you want to use this ENGLISH package,
you MUST replace all the original /utility/ folder
with this one!


1. Before the upgrade, in order to ensure the correct processing,
   it is strongly recommended to backup all the original data,
   and current database!
   We can not provide any technical support for customers who
   did not make a backup before the upgrade!
   
2. Typically, our upgrade program is update.php,
   it is placed in the ./utility/ directory of the product release.

3. In most cases, after you have upgraded to Discuz! X products,
   most of features at your site may not work properly.
   You have to log in into your admin-center and update all the Cache!
