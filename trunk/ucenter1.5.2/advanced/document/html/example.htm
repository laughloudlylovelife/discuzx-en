<h3>Example program</h3>

<div class="mainmsg">


In order to facilitate the development, we put all the UCenter interface function together to produce a sample program. To run this example program, you need to do to work as follows: <br /> <br />
1. sample program does not contain a default client directory, if you want to run this sample program, copy the client installation package UCenter example programs to the root directory. <br />
2. in UCenter add an application, set the example to run the URL and other information, communication keys are free to fill out, such as "123456." <br />
3. open the sample program to connect UCenter config.inc.php to set examples of the way, set the database connection parameters. "UC_KEY" complete set of communication in UCenter key (the example of the "12345"), "UC_APPID" fill out the application just to add ID. <br />
<br />

ucexample_1.php for the sample program without the user's master file table <br />
ucexample_2.php users to have their own examples of program master file table <br /> <br />
