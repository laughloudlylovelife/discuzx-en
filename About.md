If you are waiting for a high quality professional English translation, this package is not for you!
This package prepared only for demonstration purposes, for show the Discuz!X engine possibilities to non-chinese speaking people.
Most of texts are autotranslated by Google Translator.

So, if you want a brilliant English - do it by yourself! :)


YET NOT TRANSLATED:

/data/ipdata/tinyipdata.dat - it is a correspondence between IP adress range and country name,

To solve this problem I need a help to compile/decompile this file.
