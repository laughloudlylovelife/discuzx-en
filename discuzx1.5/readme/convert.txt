This document is designed to help you to convert the existing
community products to the Discuz! X series products.

Before you start the conversion, be sure to read step by step
the following precautions:

1. Before the conversion, in order to ensure the correct processing,
   it is strongly recommended to backup all the original data,
   and your current database!
   We can not provide any technical support for customers
   who did not make a backup before the upgrade!
   
2. Typically, our conversion program placed in the /utility/convert/ directory
   of the product release, and can be run independently of the product.

3. We can not guarantee a successfull conversion to Discuz! X,
   if not all the product data are valid, or some plug-ins or
   functional data were modified or developed by your own needs

4. In most cases, after you have converted to Discuz! X product,
   you have to go to your admin-center, and update all the cache!
   Elsewhere some features may not work properly.

5. Unless the special statements, our conversion program will not change
   your original data format and values, it would copy the original
   data and then perform the format conversion.
   So, before the conversion, you should check if your database storage space
   is sufficient.
   Assuming your original data is 100M, so you need at least 110M free space
   above the data, otherwise your product can not be converted successfully.

6. After a successful upgrade, please delete the conversion program
   to avoid possible security problems.

 FAQ
+--------------------------------------+

1. Must I install DiscuzX first?
   In most cases yes, especially during the conversion time,
   this is the most critical step, or can not be converted successfully

2. I have installed two products: Discuz! Forum and UChome.
   Can it both be converted to DiscuzX?
   Yes, it can. DiscuzX integrates functions of the Forum and the UCHome,
   so after the conversion two your products will be integrated into one

3. Is there any special requirements for conversion Discuz! and UChome?
   During the conversion, you must install on your site DiscuzX program
   and ensure that it functions properly.
   If you only install a certain product, then switch to DiscuzX is easy to
   follow the prompts.
   If you have two or more products, then pay attention to the order of
   product conversion. You should first convert your Forum to DiscuzX,
   and only then run other conversion programs, like UChome or SupeSite

4. Why when the conversion is finished, my site users are not detected
   by conversion program in the Ucenter data table?
   If you previously used the full version of Discuz! that we provided,
   the conversion program will automatically detect the Ucenter.
   However, if you are using your own ucenter installation,
   then the conversion program will not detect it.
   The solution:
       Please re-install your Discuz! X, select to install only Discuz! X
       (Ucenter Server was Installed manual),
       then fill in your Ucenter information, and start the installation.
       After finishing the re-installation start a conversion program.

5. I have a large forum. Have a conversion program any limit the data size?
   Is it possible to successfully converst my data?
   Our conversion process was heavily tested, and repeatedly successfully
   conversion more than 6GB data environment,
   so the size of original data have no limit,
   but with the larger amount of data, conversion time is longer.
   For protect your data, you should provide your server be available
   during all the conversion process.

6. How to deal with a conversion error or accident interrupt in a halfway?
   If an unexpected interruption occure, usually you should be informed
   about an error. Eliminate the errors, and then start again.
   Converter provides a high conversion mode,
   you can choose to skip some conversion steps,
   without having to start from the beginning,
   but you should be aware of what steps was performed,
   or it may result in a data conversion is not complete.
   If you have an error in the process of converting UChome or Supesite,
   and the Forum conversion at this time is not completed,
   then you may need to reconvert the Forum, and then run Uchome conversion,
   or the conversion may be unsucceed.
   Therefore, if you need to convert more than one program, i.e. Forum + UChome,
   we recommend to backup good data that has already been converted,
   after finishing of each conversion process.
   If a process was interrupted, you can restore the backup, and then continue.

7. Does the conversion process require a human intervention on it?
   After filling some information and selecting the converted product,
   the conversion program start and will automatically run and jump,
   so you do not need to intervene.
   Inappropriate intervention into the conversion process may interrupt
   or fail the process.
