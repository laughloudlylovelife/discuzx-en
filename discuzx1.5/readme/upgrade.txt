This document is designed to help you to upgrade your current version
of any Comsenz product (not Discuz!X Series) to the latest Discuz! X version.

This upgrade program can also be used for upgrading any previous Discuz!X
versions to the latest version.

Before you start the upgrade process, be sure to read step by step
the following instruction:


1. Before the upgrade, in order to ensure the correct processing,
   it is strongly recommended to backup all the original data,
   and your current database!
   We can not provide any technical support for customers
   who did not make a backup before the upgrade!
   
2. Typically, our upgrade program is update.php,
   and it is placed in the /utility/ directory of the product release.

3. In most cases, after you upgrade to the Discuz! X product,
   you need to go to your admin-center, and update all the cache!
   Elsewhere some features may not work properly.

4. After a successful upgrade, please delete the update program
   to avoid possible security problems.
